# ZooProject üêæ

A Java OOP project that simulates a zoo using classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Features
- Organized using Java packages
- Multiple animal types (`Elephant`, `Lion`, `Monkey`, `Zebra`)
- Shared behavior through a base `Animal` class
- Overridden methods for custom sounds and details
- Stored animals in an `ArrayList` and looped through them dynamically

## Purpose
Built as part of my object-oriented programming practice to demonstrate clean structure, inheritance, and polymorphic behavior in Java.

## Tools
- Java
- VS Code
